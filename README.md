This is a number guessing game, revolving around logical thinking and implementation of a good strategy. 
The computer generates a random number in each game, ranging between 1 - 20 (1 & 20 are included).

Instructions:

1. Enter your guess and check
2. See if your guess is too high or too low (It may even be the correct one!)
3. Change your guess and check again
4. Your score for the round decreases with the number of guesses you take
5. You Highscore is logged and you can repeat the game again and try to beat your previous Highscore
